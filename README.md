# CRB and MLE tool 
This code allows the computation of the Cram√©r-Rao Lower Bound (CRB) and Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of a received signal affected by the Doppler effect (b) and a time-delay (\tau). 
# Context
This code was developed in Matlab, and published as suplementary material to support the following journal contribution: 
"_On the asymptotic performance of time-delay and Doppler estimation with a carrier modulated by a band-limited signal_"
